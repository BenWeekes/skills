# Agora Skills

Structured reference knowledge for [Agora](https://www.agora.io) (agora.io) real-time communication SDKs, designed for AI coding assistants. Covers RTC (video/voice), RTM (signaling/messaging), Conversational AI (voice AI agents), and server-side token generation.

## Quick Install — Claude Code

Run these two commands inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add BenWeekes/skills
/plugin install agora@agora-skills
```

Then **restart Claude Code** (exit and reopen). The skill will appear in `/skills` and activate automatically when you mention Agora, RTC, RTM, video calling, conversational AI, etc.

## Other Installation Methods

### Claude Code — Manual Symlink

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenWeekes/skills.git ~/agora-skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s ~/agora-skills/agora/skills/agora ~/.claude/skills/agora
```

Restart Claude Code after creating the symlink.

### Claude Code — Project-Level

Copy the skill into your project so all team members get it automatically:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r /path/to/skills/agora/skills/agora .claude/skills/agora
```

### Other AI Assistants

The skill files are plain markdown — any AI coding assistant that supports custom knowledge or context files can use them. Point your tool at `agora/skills/agora/` or individual files:

- **Cursor** — Add files to `.cursor/rules/` or reference in project settings
- **Windsurf** — Add files to your Cascade context
- **Copilot** — Reference via `@workspace` or include in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Any tool with custom context** — Feed `SKILL.md` as the entry point; it links to everything else

RTC/RTM/TEN leaf files have inline code examples; ConvoAI/server files use TOC + links to upstream repos and official docs. You can also load individual files directly.

---

## What This Is

This repo contains markdown skill files that give AI coding assistants deep knowledge of Agora's platform. When a developer asks for help with Agora, the assistant loads the relevant reference material — from high-level product overviews down to platform-specific code examples and API details.

**Products covered:**
- **RTC (Video/Voice SDK)** — Web, React, iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin/Java)
- **RTM (Signaling)** — Web (JS/TS) messaging, presence, metadata, stream channels
- **Conversational AI** — REST API, agent config, 5 recipe repos (agent-samples, agent-toolkit, agent-ui-kit, server-custom-llm, server-mcp)
- **Server-Side** — Token generation for Node.js, Python, Go
- **TEN Framework** — Extension development, graph configuration, Docker operations, debugging

## Design — 4-Layer Progressive Disclosure

LLM context windows are finite. Load the minimum needed, go deeper only when required.

| Layer | What | Size | When Loaded |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **1 — Description** | Trigger keywords in `SKILL.md` frontmatter | ~100 words | Always (skill index) |
| **2 — SKILL.md body** | Core concepts, product index, framework notes | ~72 lines | On activation |
| **3 — Product README** | Overview, critical rules, topic links | 20–100 lines | Per product |
| **4 — Topic files** | Implementation detail, code examples, API reference, or TOC + links | 34–500 lines | Per topic |

Navigation: `SKILL.md` → product `README.md` → topic file (e.g., `web.md`, `agent-samples.md`).

### Link-First vs Inline

Not all content belongs inline. The skill uses two strategies depending on how fast upstream content moves and how well it's documented:

| Product | Strategy | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| **RTC / RTM** | Inline code examples | Stable APIs, official docs lack good examples |
| **TEN Framework** | Inline code + operations | Hard-won knowledge, thin upstream docs |
| **Conversational AI** | TOC + links to repo READMEs and AGENT.md | Fast-moving, 5 upstream repos with good docs |
| **Server / Tokens** | TOC + links to official docs | Well-documented at docs.agora.io |

ConvoAI files are aligned 1:1 with repos in [AgoraIO-Conversational-AI](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI). Each file maps to one repo and links to its README and AGENT.md as sources of truth. Gotchas and quirks that LLMs consistently get wrong stay inline in the ConvoAI README.

## Maintaining and Extending

### Adding a New Product

1. Create `references/{product}/README.md` (Layer 3)
2. Add an entry to the **Products** section of `SKILL.md`
3. Create topic files as needed (Layer 4)

### Adding a New Platform

1. Create `references/{product}/{platform}.md` (Layer 4)
2. Add a link in the product's `README.md`

### Updating Content

- Edit the specific Layer 4 file.
- **Inline files** (RTC, RTM, TEN): Keep code examples current, keep **Official Documentation** URLs at the bottom.
- **Link-first files** (ConvoAI, server): Update TOC links when upstream repos restructure. Keep gotchas/quirks inline only for things LLMs get wrong that aren't obvious in upstream docs.
- Don't duplicate content that lives in upstream repo READMEs or AGENT.md — link to it instead.

### Verifying URLs

```bash
grep -roh 'https://[^ )]*' agora/ | sort -u | while read url; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -L --max-time 10 "$url")
  echo "$code $url"
done
```
