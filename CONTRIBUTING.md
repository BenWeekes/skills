# Contributing to Agora Agent Skills

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository provides reusable skills that help AI coding agents build applications on the Agora platform.

## Scope

This repository stores AI agent skills for Agora (agora.io) platform integration,
following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.
Changes should improve routing accuracy, code generation quality, and maintainability.

## Adding a New Product Skill

1. Create `skills/agora/references/{product}/README.md` (Layer 3 — overview,
   critical rules, topic links, 20–100 lines)
2. Add an entry to the **Products** section of `skills/agora/SKILL.md`
3. Create topic files as needed: `skills/agora/references/{product}/{topic}.md`
   (Layer 4 — 34–500 lines)
4. Apply the freeze-forever test to all inline content (see below)
5. Add at least one eval case to `tests/eval-cases.md` for the new product

## Adding a New Platform

1. Create `skills/agora/references/{product}/{platform}.md` (Layer 4)
2. Add a link in the product's `README.md`

## The Freeze-Forever Test

Before adding any factual content inline, ask: **will this still be correct in 6 months
without any updates?**

- **Yes** (stable API patterns, initialization sequences, token generation, RTC track
  management, TEN Framework operations): put it **inline**.
- **No** (REST API parameter lists, SDK changelogs, vendor configurations, model names,
  ConvoAI request/response schemas): put it **behind an MCP call** or an **external link**.
  Never hardcode fast-moving content.

Ben's existing link-first vs inline decision table in `README.md` already encodes this
principle. Follow it. When in doubt, add a new row to that table and document your
reasoning in the PR description.

The freeze-forever test applies to new content only. Do not remove existing inline
examples from RTC, RTM, TEN Framework, or token generation files — these are stable
APIs where inline examples are the primary competitive value.

## Updating a Gotcha or Critical Rule

The 30+ documented gotchas in `references/rtc/README.md` and
`references/conversational-ai/README.md` are the most valuable content in this repo.
They represent debugging knowledge that LLMs consistently get wrong. Before updating:

1. Verify the behavior against the latest SDK version. Check the release notes linked
   at the bottom of `README.md`.
2. If the behavior changed in a specific SDK version, include that version in the
   gotcha description (e.g., "Fixed in agora-rtc-sdk-ng v4.21").
3. Do not remove a gotcha because it "seems obvious" — these were written because
   LLMs consistently generated the wrong code. The test cases in `tests/eval-cases.md`
   provide the evidence.
4. If a gotcha no longer applies to any supported SDK version, move it to a
   `## Historical Notes` section at the bottom of the file rather than deleting it.

## Required Frontmatter

Every `SKILL.md` must include:

    ---
    name: kebab-case-name          # max 64 chars, unique across repo
    description: >-
      Trigger phrases and description that help agents recognize when to use
      this skill. Include concrete product names and action verbs.
    license: MIT
    metadata:
      author: agora
      version: "X.Y.Z"
    ---

Rules:
- Do NOT use `triggers` as a top-level frontmatter field — fold trigger phrases
  into `description`. (Consistent with agentskills.io standard.)
- Use relative links for all local references.
- Put detailed docs under `references/`; keep `SKILL.md` focused on workflow.

## Naming

- Directory names: lowercase kebab-case
- Skill names (frontmatter `name`): unique across repository, lowercase kebab-case
- Use `agora-` prefix for new product skill directories
- Never use `shengwang-` prefixes — this repo uses Agora-branded paths throughout

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Freeze-forever test applied to all new inline content (see above)
- [ ] Routing still correct from `skills/agora/SKILL.md`
- [ ] New or changed local links are valid (no broken relative paths)
- [ ] No duplicate skill names
- [ ] No absolute local paths (`/Users/...` or any machine-specific path)
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or App Certificates
- [ ] At least one eval case added or updated in `tests/eval-cases.md`
  (required for new product or platform additions)
- [ ] If adding a code generation skill: testing guidance updated in
  `references/testing-guidance/SKILL.md`
- [ ] `scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes locally
